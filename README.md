# Gragas Assistant

Gragas Assistant is a Python-based software designed to assist individuals with physical disabilities who have difficulty accepting matches or selecting champions quickly enough in League of Legends. This project aims to enhance accessibility and provide an automated solution for handling champion selection and match acceptance.

## Features

- **Automatic Match Acceptance**: Automatically accept matches when they are found.
- **Champion and Ban Selection**: Prioritize and automatically select or ban champions from a customizable list.

## Installation

This project is still under development, and a `.exe` executable will be provided once the main features are completed. For now, the application can be run from the source code using Python.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for the web interface)
- Other dependencies will be added as needed.

## Roadmap
